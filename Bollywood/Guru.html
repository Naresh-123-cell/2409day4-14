    <h2>Story</h2>

    <p>The Beginning in 1951, Guru tells the story of a ruthlessly ambitious villager who moves to Turkey first and <mark>Mumbai</mark> later with his wife Sujata and brother-in-law Jignesh to fulfill his dreams. "Guru" tells the story of Gurukant Desai.
        <br>In Mumbai, truth dawns upon Guru that the business world is a closed community ruled by a handful of rich and influential people who don't believe in giving opportunities to new players. Despite barriers, he starts a company called Shakti Trading and climbs the ladder of success at a furious pace.

    <p>Manik Dasgupta aka Nanaji, who publishes a newspaper Swatantra, treats Guru as his son. Guru likewise looks to Manik Dasgupta as a father figure who gives him support during his early struggling days in Bombay. He also develops a <strong>strong friendship</strong> with Manik Dasgupta's granddaughter, Meenu. Meenu develops multiple sclerosis as she grows up, and becomes confined to a wheelchair in the latter part of the film.<br>
        As Gurukant Desai's business grows into one of the largest in India, he ruthlessly pursues success. He smuggles in parts for his polyester mills, illegally creates goods, and manipulates stocks to make a higher profit. But when Manik Dasgupta learns that Guru's means of success are not always honest, he, along with a reporter of his newspaper, Shyam (Madhavan), decide to expose Guru's increasingly corrupt ways.

    <p>The stress of his battle with the newspaper causes Guru to have a stroke, and he is paralyzed on his right side. Meanwhile, Meenu is slowly weakening from her illness, and eventually dies. In the end, Guru is brought before a government inquiry into his unethical actions, but he persuades the panel to clear him of most of the charges he is charged with less allegations & lets to run his company, and the film ends with Guru continuing to dream of future, and even greater, success and leading his company the <ins>world's</ins> biggest company.</p>
